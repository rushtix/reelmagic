## Founder Statement: Why I Believe The Future of Entertainment is Interactive ##
Jill Bourque, CEO of RushTix

**Early Career and the Power of "Yes, And"**

Early in my career, I took an improv class to level up my communication skills for my job in finance. I immediately clicked with the underlying concept of “Yes, and” which means that you take what’s presented to you in a scene and say “yes” and build upon the idea. This simple idea changed the trajectory of my life in the best possible ways.

**Creation of "How We First Met"**

I started performing in shows and then creating my own. One of them, "How We First Met", became extremely successful. The concept was that a host interviews a couple on stage and then at strategic points in the story segues to a team of improvisers and musicians to theatrically re-create their love story in real-time, complete with sketches, songs, dancing, and multimedia. You can see some of the press clippings about the show [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cgdxqelieymjiss/combinepdf.pdf?dl=0).

**The Shift Towards Audience Participation**

In 2007, I started to notice a shift in the appetite for audience participation. With the rise of social media, audience members became very interested in participating. Today, with the rise of influencer culture, this trend is accelerating. The audience wants to be part of the show, especially Gen Z. They are accustomed to being in the driver’s seat of their entertainment.

**The Secret of Interactive Entertainment Is Structure**

The secret of interactive entertainment is structure. "How We First Met" looked like magic because the audience was stunned that we could create an entertaining fully improvised theatrical show from a story being told in real-time that we had never heard before. In fact, many times, audience members thought we had scripted it beforehand. The secret was that we had created a very tight structure behind it all. You can see one of the playbooks I created for a group I taught in Norway [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xca6qjtrl01tw1a/HWFM%20Player%20Handbook%20-%202013%20-%20Norway.pdf?dl=0).

**The Future of Entertainment: Real-time TV Shows and Films**

We’re now at an exciting point because livestreaming is ubiquitous. And with the progress of generative AI models, it’s possible to create almost limitless content. Add in the interactive story engine we’ve built and it brings us into a whole new world of entertainment.

I strongly believe in a future of amazing real-time TV shows and films. Streaming content that is created in the moment, like “How We First Met” but streaming live to millions. And what I know from my past experience is that structure is the key to success.
