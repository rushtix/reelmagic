# 5. Ecosystem

We are building the ultimate destination to experience interactive stories. Our vision is to have thousands of IGE titles, all of which can be played a multitude of times. Members can replay titles as no two experiences, or groups of members, are the same. We see the market in three main parts: 

For simplicity we call the interactive stories Experiences and the participants are Members. The creators of the experiences are Creators and those who lead the experiences are called Hosts.

## 1. Revenue Share Model
We value our Creators and Hosts and the unique content they bring to our community. To recognize their contributions, we have set up a Revenue Share Model where a portion of the subscription revenue is placed into an Engagement Revenue Pool. Each month, Creators and Hosts earn a share of this pool proportional to the engagement their content generates. This includes factors such as the number of views, the level of interaction, and the degree of overall user participation. This model ensures that the success of our Creators and Hosts is tied directly to their ability to create engaging, high-quality content and foster an active community.

## 2. Creators
We are currently developing experiences internally and are conducting outreach to potential creators who would be interested in bringing their work to our ecosystem.
- Interactive Fiction Writers (example: [5,000 IF games on Itch.io](https://itch.io/games/tag-twine))
- Independent Video Game Creators (example Roblox, Itch, Steam)
- Immersive Theater Designers ([see 2020 report on immersive entertainment](https://everythingimmersive.com/storage/website-files/documents/2020%20Immersive%20Entertainment%20Industry%20Annual%20Report.pdf))
- Livestreamers on Twitch, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok who are highly interactive with their fan base.
- Traditional Showrunners and TV/Movie Writers who want to expand into new realms.

## 3. Hosts
Those who lead the experiences and engage members. Our Go-to-Market Strategy is to target influencers who want a fun way to engage and monetize their fanbase. Weâ€™ve learned the following from our work with influencers over the past few years:

- Ethical Monetization: Influencers are motivated to monetize their fanbase BUT it needs to be fun and engaging - not a money grab. 
- Easy of Use: They are looking for fan experiences that are easy to do. With our shows they simply select an experience to play with their fans and set a date. There is no prepwork involved. They just show up and have fun with their fans. 
- Authentic & Personal: Influencers seek authentic and personal experiences for their fans - this is how they truly bond with their community. With our shows, the fans are truly part of the experience and not just mixed into a chat wall of comments. 

Initially, we anticipate that Creators and Hosts will be in separate roles as they embody different skill sets. Though we anticipate that individuals (and teams) will emerge that do both extremely well. 

## 4. Members
Members can participate in many experiences for free and also subscribe to gain access to premium experiences, along with additional perks and enhancements. While we see this form of entertainment as fun for all ages, we predict that Gen Z, in particular, will find it especially compelling as they have come of age and actively participate in entertainment. This [Deloitte research](https://everythingimmersive.com/storage/website-files/documents/2020%20Immersive%20Entertainment%20Industry%20Annual%20Report.pdf) has insights into this trend, namely that Gen Z respondents cited playing video games as their favorite entertainment activity.
