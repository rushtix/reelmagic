# About Us

RushTix is an experience company that believes in the power of shared experiences. We started as a subscription experience platform where users could discover and attend amazing experiences for a low monthly fee. 

In 2016, we created a bot named Roscoe bot which won the 2016 IBM Watson Conversation Bot Competition in two categories: Most Useful and Best Natural Language Processing. 

During the pandemic in 2020, we pivoted to paid livestreaming, becoming the largest stand-up comedy livestreamer. We had the privilege of working with top comedians like Sarah Silverman, Patton Oswalt, Jeff Dunham, Maria Bamford, and many more. 

Now, we have used our background in bots and livestreaming to build ReelMagic. ReelMagic is a ground-breaking entertainment platform where advanced generative AI and the dynamic energy of group chats converge to form compelling, interactive fiction experiences brought to life through immersive video content. 

In the world of ReelMagic, you aren't just a spectator; you're a participant. Your chats with characters shape the narrative, creating a personalized storyline that responds and evolves in real time based on your interactions. The result is a rich and engaging experience where every conversation adds depth to your adventure.

Founded by Jill Bourque and her dedicated team of innovators, ReelMagic is built on the belief that AI has the potential to transform storytelling. We stand at the crossroads of technology and creativity, exploring uncharted territory in the realm of interactive, AI-generated narratives. Every conversation you have on ReelMagic deepens your connection to the story, leading to a wholly unique and exciting journey every time.
