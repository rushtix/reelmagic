# Tech Stack 🔧

Welcome to the Tech Stack page of the ReelMagic Knowledge Base. Here you will learn about the technologies and AI models that power ReelMagic.

## Technologies Used 🧰

- **Platform Technologies**: At the core of our platform lies a robust and modern technology stack that enables us to deliver a seamless and immersive experience to our users. We leverage a range of cutting-edge technologies to power different aspects of our platform. For backend development and seamless AI integration, we rely on technologies such as FFmpeg, which allows us to handle various multimedia processing tasks effectively. Additionally, we harness the power of WebGL to bring rich and interactive visual elements to our platform, enhancing the overall user experience. To ensure efficient and scalable operations, we utilize Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime environment that enables us to build fast and scalable backend systems. This allows us to handle large amounts of data processing and deliver real-time interactions with minimal latency. Moreover, we leverage React.js, a popular JavaScript library, to develop our frontend user interfaces, creating intuitive and responsive interfaces that enhance user engagement. We also leverage cloud technologies such as GCP, AWS, and Azure for scalable infrastructure.

- **Generative AI**: We harness the power of cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to bring our stories to life with captivating real-time narratives. Through the utilization of these advanced AI technologies, we are able to dynamically generate storylines, characters, and plot developments that adapt and respond to user interactions in real-time. This AI-driven approach adds an element of immersion and interactivity to our stories, allowing readers to actively engage with the unfolding narrative and influence its direction through their choices and actions. By leveraging the capabilities of AI, we aim to provide an innovative and dynamic storytelling experience that captivates our audience and pushes the boundaries of traditional storytelling formats.


## AI Models 🧠
